<p><h2 className='h2headingtag' >Why is Arti Performed Twice a Day?</h2>Arti is meant to be performed at sunrise and sunset. At sunrise the raja-tama predominant atmosphere present throughout the night is destroyed and the absolute fire element frequencies of 
              Deities arrive in the universe. Hence, Arti is to be offered at sunrise to welcome them. The ‘tarak Chaitanya’ (saviour form of Chaitanya) transmitted during the arrival of the frequencies of 
              Deities at sunrise is to be welcomed by the worshipper through the medium of the Arti, whereas at sunset, the Arti is performed to destroy the raja-tama frequencies and to invoke the Deities’ ‘marak Chaitanya’ (destroyer form of Chaitanya). That is why Arti should be performed twice –at sunrise and at sunset.</p>
         <h2 className='h2headingtag'>Why should the Aarthi platter be Waved in a Clockwise Direction in Front of the Deity?</h2> 
        <p>As the earth moves in the clockwise direction, the frequencies in the environment do not offer any resistance to the movement of the lit lamp. </p>
        <p>The most commonly sung aarti is that which is dedicated to all deities is Om Jai Jagdish Hare, known as "The Universal Aarti" and is another common aarti song. Its variation are used for 
           other deities as well such as Om Jai Shiv omkara, Om Jai Lakshmi mata, Om Jai Ambe gauri, Om Jai Adya Shakti, Om Jai Saraswati Mata, Om Jai Gange Mata, Om Jai Tulsi Mata and Om Jai Surya Bhagvaan. In Ganesha worship, the aarti Sukhakarta Dukhaharta is popular. </p>
